This program was made initially on 11/11/2024 for use at PTA plastics with a project that involves RFID Tags. I made a large push to investigate failures that were occoring with the RFID Tags (in a specific order of 10,000 we had a 10.4 failire rate). In my efforts, I got a smaple job set up so that we could take data on every step of the process. Before molding, after molding, at the laser engraver, as well as directly after. In order to be able to do this, I needed some way to count good tags and bad tags. The purpose of this is to scan each tag after IMM and if it does not scan, the part is tossed into a hold box for later inspection (looking at the cavity num and counting fails). So the only real thing that this program needed to do is show that the tag scanned properly, and not do anything if the tag has failed.... TBC
